# Microbit Morse Code Sender

[![Project Status: Completed](./assets/images/badges/status.svg)](./)

> A script that allows you to send morse code between two Microbits.

This is in no way practical, but it's cool to see that it's at least possible.

## Usage

See the morse code chart below for help:

![Morse Code](./assets/images/Morse%20Code.png)

In the above diagram:
- The dots &centerdot; represent short signals.
- The dashes - represent long signals.

1. Button **A** is a short signal.
2. Button **B** is a long signal.
3. Begin by typing out a letter using the **A** and **B** buttons.
4. When you are done, type the termination sequence **AAAAB**. This will add the letter to what will be sent.
5. To send the current string, type the *end* character by typing **ABAB**. This will send the string to all other Microbits on the radio frequency.
